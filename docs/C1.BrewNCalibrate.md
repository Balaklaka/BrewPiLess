After version 4.4, the calibration data survives through brews. The maximum number of calibration pairs is 10.

When starting a log, the calibration data available will be written into the log file, so that tilt angles are recorded and gravity can be derived from the tilt angles. Otherwise, gravity data is recorded.

The calculated gravity is always temperature corrected. When inputing new data from main page, corrected gravity will be calculated automatically if beer temperature is available. However, no temperature correction is available if calibration data is input at "gravity device" page.
