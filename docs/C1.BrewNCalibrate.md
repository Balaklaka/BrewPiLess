After version 4.4, the calibration data survives through brews. If "Calculated by BPL" is enabled, the polynomial will be derived by the calibration data input. At least two sets of calibration data should be input to get correct formula. If only one set of data is availble, use "offset" option. 

When starting a log, the calibration data available will be written into the log file, so that tilt angles are recorded and gravity can be derived from the tilt angles. Otherwise, gravity data is recorded.

The calculated gravity is always temperature corrected. When inputing new data from main page, corrected gravity will be calculated automatically if beer temperature is available. However, no temperature correction if calibration data is input at "gravity device" page.
