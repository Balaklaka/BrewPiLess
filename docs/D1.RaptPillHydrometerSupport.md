# Rapt Pill Hydrometer

[Rapt Pill](https://www.kegland.com.au/products/yellow-rapt-pill-hydrometer-thermometer-wifi-bluetooth) utilizes the same principle as Tilt and iSpindel. When set Bluetooth/BLE mode, BrewPiLess running on ESP32 can read the bluetooth broadcast informaton.

Pill broadcasts gravity and tilt angle related information, which make it possible to run "brew and calibrate" like iSpindel.

The MAC address used for registration and displayed on Rapt Pill's Dianostics page is calculated by taking the RAPT Pill's BLE address and subtracting 2 off the last octet. Therefore, thare are TWO addresses displayed.

To find out Pills, click "Scan" button. The Pills don't broadcast all the time but wakeup and broadcast for a short period according its setting, like one or 15 minutes. It might take some time to "catch" the Pill, wait until the Pill shows up.

Pills report gravity as well as tilt information. If "Calculated by BPL" is enabled, the gravity is derived from the tilt information. Otherwise, the gravity from Pills will be used. The offset will be added to reported gravity. If "Calculated by BPL" is enabled, at least two sets of calibration data is necessary to derive a formula. Before a valid formula is available, no gravity data will be reported. The calibratin data will survives through brews. If the center of mass of the Pill is altered when opened for charging, the calibration data should be removed manually.
